Description: cellmarkeraccordion is an R package designed to obtain a robust identification of 
	healthy and disease critical populations in single-cell and spatial omics datasets in multiple tissues.
	Additionally, the cellmarkeraccordion allows an easy interpretation of the results.
	The cellmarkeraccordion package allows to automatically annotate normal and disease 
	critical cell populations based on the built-in Accordion gene marker database. It requires in 
	input only the counts matrix (raw or normalized) or a Seurat object. In addition, by exploiting 
	the built-in cell cycle labeling you can easily assign the cell cycle phase to each cell. 
	The users can also customize the annotation by simply providing their own genes list as input, 
	which can be associated with cell types or even to specific pathways or signatures of interest. 
	Importantly, the Accordion implements novel options to explore annotation results by inspecting 
	for each group of cells the top marker genes which mostly impacted the annotation, together with 
	the top cell types and their relationship based on the cell ontology tree.
